=== Support for Google Cloud Infrastructure Manager

Cloud Volumes ONTAP now uses https://docs.cloud.google.com/infrastructure-manager/docs/overview[Google Cloud Infrastructure Manager] (IM) instead of https://docs.cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/deprecations[Cloud Deployment Manager] for all new deployments in Google Cloud. This change has been made because Google will deprecate Google Cloud Deployment Manager in the near future. 

For your existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployments in Google Cloud, you need to run a transition tool for migrating from Cloud Deployment Manager to Cloud Infrastructure Manager.

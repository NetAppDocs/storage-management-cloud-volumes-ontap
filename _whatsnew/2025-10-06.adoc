=== BlueXP is now NetApp Console

The NetApp Console, built on the enhanced and restructured BlueXP foundation, provides centralized management of NetApp storage and NetApp Data Services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise gradeâ€”delivering real-time insights, faster workflows, and simplified administration, that is highly secure and compliant.

=== Simplified Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployment in AWS

You can now deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS using a quick deployment method for both single-node and high-availability (HA) configurations. This streamlined process reduces the number of steps compared to the advanced method, automatically sets default values on a single page, and minimizes navigation, making deployment faster and easier.

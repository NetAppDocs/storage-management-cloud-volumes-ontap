=== BlueXP is now NetApp Console

BlueXP has been renamed and redesigned to better reflect its role in managing your data infrastructure.

=== Simplified Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployment in AWS

You can now deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS using a quick deployment method for both single-node and high-availability (HA) configurations. This streamlined process reduces the number of steps compared to the advanced method, automatically sets default values on a single page, and minimizes navigation, making deployment faster and easier.

=== Azure VNet support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configurations

Beginning with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.18.1, high-availability (HA) configurations in Azure single and multiple availability zones support Azure Virtual Network (VNet) encryption as part of its layered security strategy to protect data in transit. Cloud Volumes ONTAP leverages Azure's native Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol to secure communication between ONTAP nodes, management interfaces, and other Azure services, preventing interception and unauthorized access. This network-level encryption complements ONTAP's built-in storage and data-at-rest protections to deliver end-to-end security of your data. 

For ensuring that your Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA deployments can use this security feature, you need to configure the HA mode for your subscriptions. Refer to

== Capacity-based license

Capacity-based licensing enables you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity. Capacity-based licensing is available in the form of a _package_: the Essentials or Professional package.

The Essentials and Professional packages are available with the following consumption models or purchase options:

* A license (bring your own license (BYOL)) purchased from NetApp
* An hourly, pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription from the Google Cloud Marketplace
* An annual contract

link:concept-licensing.html#capacity-based-licensing[Learn more about capacity-based licensing].

The following sections describe how to get started with each of these consumption models.

=== BYOL

Pay upfront by purchasing a license (BYOL) from NetApp to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in any cloud provider.

[NOTE]
NetApp has restricted the purchase, extension, and renewal of BYOL licensing. For more information, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/whats-new.html#restricted-availability-of-byol-licensing-for-cloud-volumes-ontap[Restricted availability of BYOL licensing for Cloud Volumes ONTAP^].

.Steps

. https://www.netapp.com/forms/sales-contact/[Contact NetApp Sales to obtain a license^]

. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html#add-an-nss-account[Add your NetApp Support Site account to the NetApp Console^]
+
The Console automatically queries NetApp's licensing service to obtain details about the licenses associated with your NetApp Support Site account. If there are no errors, the Console adds the licenses.
+
Your license must be available from the Console before you can use it with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. If needed, you can link:task-manage-capacity-licenses.html#add-purchased-licenses-to-your-account[manually add the license to the Console].

. On the *Systems* page, click *Add System* and follow the steps.

.. On the *Details and Credentials* page, click *Edit Credentials > Add Subscription* and then follow the prompts to subscribe to the pay-as-you-go offering in the Google Cloud Marketplace.
+
The license that you purchased from NetApp is always charged first, but you'll be charged from the hourly rate in the marketplace if you exceed your licensed capacity or if the term of your license expires.

.. After you return to the Console, select a capacity-based package when you reach the charging methods page.

=== PAYGO subscription

Pay hourly by subscribing to the offer from your cloud provider's marketplace.

When you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, the Console prompts you to subscribe to the agreement that's available in the Google Cloud Marketplace. That subscription is then associated with the system for charging. You can use that same subscription for additional systems.

.Steps

. From the left navigation menu, select *Storage > Management*.

. On the *Systems* page, click *Add System* and follow the steps.

.. On the *Details and Credentials* page, click *Edit Credentials > Add Subscription* and then follow the prompts to subscribe to the pay-as-you-go offering in the Google Cloud Marketplace.

.. After you return to the Console, select a capacity-based package when you reach the charging methods page.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP includes a cluster admin account. You can change the password for this account from NetApp Console, if needed.

CAUTION: You should not change the password for the admin account through ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. The password will not be reflected in the Console. As a result, the Console cannot monitor the instance properly.

.About this task

The password must observe a few rules. The new password:

* Shouldn't contain the word `admin`
* Must be between eight and 50 characters in length
* Must contain at least one English letter and one digit
* Shouldn't contain these special characters: `/ ( ) { } [ ] # : % " ? \`

.Steps

. On the *Systems* page, double-click the name of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. On the upper right of the Console, click the image:icon-action.png[] icon, and select *Set password*.

Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Azure in a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Create a Console agent

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't have a https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Console agent^] yet, you need to create one. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-azure.html[Learn how to create a Console agent in Azure^]

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Note that if you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a subnet where no internet access is available, then you need to manually install the Console agent and access the NetApp Console that's running on that Console agent. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-private-mode.html[Learn how to manually install the Console agent in a location without internet access^]

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Plan your configuration

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Console offers preconfigured packages that match your workload requirements, or you can create your own configuration. If you choose your own configuration, you should understand the options available to you. For information, refer to link:task-planning-your-config-azure.html[Plan your Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration in Azure].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure that your VNet and subnets will support connectivity between the Console agent and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. Enable outbound internet access from the target VPC for NetApp AutoSupport.

This step isn't required if you're deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a location where no internet access is available.

summary: You should always delete Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, rather than from your cloud provider's console. For example, if you terminate a licensed Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance from your cloud provider, then you can't use the license key for another instance. You must delete the system to release the license.

You should always delete Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems from the NetApp Console, rather than from your cloud provider's application. For example, if you terminate a licensed Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance from your cloud provider, then you can't use the license key for another instance. You must delete the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system from the Console to release the license.

When you delete a system, the Console terminates Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances and deletes disks and snapshots.

[NOTE]
Other resources, such as backups managed by NetApp Backup and Recovery, and instances for NetApp Data Classification, are not deleted when you delete a system. You'll need to manually delete them. If you don't, then you'll continue to incur charges for these resources. 

When the Console deploys Cloud Volumes ONTAP in your cloud provider, it enables termination protection on the instances. This option helps prevent accidental termination.

.Steps

. If you enabled Backup and Recovery on the system, determine whether the backed up data is still required and then https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/task-manage-backups-ontap.html#deleting-backups[delete the backups, if necessary^].
+
Backup and Recovery is independent from Cloud Volumes ONTAP by design. Backup and Recovery doesn't automatically delete backups when you delete a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, and there is no current support in the UI to delete the backups after the system has been deleted.

. If you enabled Data Classification on this system and no other systems use this service, then you need to delete the instance for the service.

. Delete the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.. On the *Systems* page, double-click the name of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that you want to delete.

.. On the upper right of the Console, click the image:icon-action.png[] icon, and select *Delete*.
.. Type the name of the system you want to delete, and then click *Delete*. It can take up to five minutes to delete a system.

[NOTE]
Backup and Recovery is free only for Cloud Volumes ONTAP Professional licenses. This free benefit does not apply to deleted environments. If backed up copies of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP environment are retained in a Backup and Recovery instance, you will be charged for the backed up copies until they are deleted.

The following table describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| System Name | The Console uses the system name to name both the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and the Google Cloud VM instance. It also uses the name as the prefix for the predefined security group, if you select that option.

| Service Account Name | If you plan to use link:concept-data-tiering.html[data tiering] or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/concept-backup-to-cloud.html[NetApp Backup and Recovery^] with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you need to enable *Service Account* and select a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role. link:task-creating-gcp-service-account.html[Learn how to create a service account^].

| Add Labels |	Labels are metadata for your Google Cloud resources. The Console adds the labels to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and Google Cloud resources associated with the system.

You can add up to four labels from the user interface when creating a system, and then you can add more after it's created. Note that the API does not limit you to four labels when creating a system.

For information about labels, refer to the https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources[Google Cloud Documentation: Labeling Resources^].

| User name and password | These are the credentials for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP cluster administrator account. You can use these credentials to connect to Cloud Volumes ONTAP through ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. Keep the default _admin_ user name or change it to a custom user name.

| Edit Project a| Select the project where you want Cloud Volumes ONTAP to reside. The default project is the project where of the Console.

If you don't see any additional projects in the drop-down list, then you haven't yet associated the service account with other projects. Go to the Google Cloud console, open the IAM service, and select the project. Add the service account with the role that you use for the Console to that project. You'll need to repeat this step for each project.

NOTE: This is the service account that you set up for the Console, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-google.html[as described on this page^].

Click *Add Subscription* to associate the selected credentials with a subscription.

To create a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, you need to select a Google Cloud project that's associated with a subscription to Cloud Volumes ONTAP from the Google Cloud marketplace. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-gcp-accounts.html[Associating a marketplace subscription with Google Cloud credentials^].

+
. *Services*: Select the services that you want to use on this system. In order to select Backup and Recovery, or to use NetApp Cloud Tiering, you must have specified the Service Account in step 3.
+
TIP: If you would like to utilize WORM and data tiering, you must disable Backup and Recovery and deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system with version 9.8 or above.

. *Location & Connectivity*: Select a location, choose a firewall policy, and confirm network connectivity to Google Cloud storage for data tiering.
+
The following table describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| Connectivity verification | To tier cold data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, the subnet in which Cloud Volumes ONTAP resides must be configured for Private Google Access. For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Google Cloud Documentation: Configuring Private Google Access^].

| Generated firewall policy a| If you let the Console generate the firewall policy for you, you need to choose how you'll allow traffic:

* If you choose *Selected VPC only*, the source filter for inbound traffic is the subnet range of the selected VPC and the subnet range of the VPC where the Console agent resides. This is the recommended option.
* If you choose *All VPCs*, the source filter for inbound traffic is the 0.0.0.0/0 IP range.

| Use existing firewall policy | If you use an existing firewall policy, ensure that it includes the required rules: link:reference-networking-gcp.html#firewall-rules[Learn about firewall rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP]

. *Preconfigured Packages*: Select one of the packages to quickly deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, or click *Create my own configuration*.
+
If you choose one of the packages, you only need to specify a volume and then review and approve the configuration.

. *Licensing*: Change the Cloud Volumes ONTAP version as needed and select a machine type.
+
NOTE: If a newer Release Candidate, General Availability, or patch release is available for a selected version, then the Console updates the system to that version when creating it. For example, the update occurs if you select Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.13.1 and 9.13.1 P4 is available. The update does not occur from one release to anotherâ€” for example, from 9.13 to 9.14.

. *Underlying Storage Resources*: Choose settings for the initial aggregate: a disk type and the size for each disk.
+
The disk type is for the initial volume. You can choose a different disk type for subsequent volumes.
+
The disk size is for all disks in the initial aggregate and for any additional aggregates that the Console creates when you use the simple provisioning option. You can create aggregates that use a different disk size by using the advanced allocation option.
+
For help choosing a disk type and size, refer to  link:task-planning-your-config-gcp.html#size-your-system-in-gcp[Size your system in Google Cloud^].

. *Flash Cache, Write Speed & WORM*: 

.. Enable *Flash Cache*, if desired.
+
NOTE: Starting with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.13.1, _Flash Cache_ is supported on the n2-standard-16, n2-standard-32, n2-standard-48, and n2-standard-64 instance types. You cannot disable Flash Cache after deployment. 
.. Choose *Normal* or *High* write speed, if desired.
+
link:concept-write-speed.html[Learn more about write speed].
+
NOTE: High write speed and a higher maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 8,896 bytes are available through the *High* write speed option. In addition, the higher MTU of 8,896 requires the selection of VPC-1, VPC-2 and VPC-3 for the deployment. For more information on VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3, refer to  https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/reference-networking-gcp.html#requirements-for-the-connector[Rules for VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3^]. 
.. Activate write once, read many (WORM) storage, if desired.
+
WORM can't be enabled if data tiering was enabled for Cloud Volumes ONTAP versions 9.7 and below. Reverting or downgrading to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 is blocked after enabling WORM and tiering. 
+
link:concept-worm.html[Learn more about WORM storage^].
.. If you activate WORM storage, select the retention period. 

. *Data Tiering in Google Cloud Platform*: Choose whether to enable data tiering on the initial aggregate, choose a storage class for the tiered data, and then either select a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role (required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 or later), or select a Google Cloud account (required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6).
+
Note the following:
+
* The Console sets the service account on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. This service account provides permissions for data tiering to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Be sure to add the Console agent service account as a user of the tiering service account, otherwise, you can't select it from the Console.
* For help with adding a Google Cloud account, refer to  https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-gcp-accounts.html[Setting up and adding Google Cloud accounts for data tiering with 9.6^].
* You can choose a specific volume tiering policy when you create or edit a volume.
* If you disable data tiering, you can enable it on subsequent aggregates, but you'll need to turn off the system and add a service account from the Google Cloud console.
+
